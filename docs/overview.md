### Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Design scalable and distributed backend architectures.
- Perform latency-throughput trade-off analysis.
- Apply CAP theorem and ACID principles in data-intensive application scenarios.
- Construct caching, rate limiting, and load balancing mechanisms.
- Design and evaluate ML production systems and pipelines.

### Lab Tools and Technologies:
**Philosophy **: *we are not dependent on any tools and technology for this course but to understand the core architecture*.

Here are a few tools that we may encounter.

- Docker & Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Redis / Memcached for caching experiments
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Cassandra for DB sharding
- Kafka / RabbitMQ for messaging queue implementation
- Nginx / HAProxy for load balancing demos
- Flask / FastAPI for service and gateway design


### Final Design Project Examples:
Final Design Projects are selected by students. Few examples that are able to be considered for projects are:

- Design a scalable YouTube-like video platform with ML recommendations
- Build a fault-tolerant URL shortener with replication and rate limiting
- Construct an e-commerce system backend with sharded search and event-driven stock updates
